# Anagram Solution

#### Accroding to definition of anagram, An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters in another word or phrase. It is important to note that the word or phrases that an anagram creates must be actual words or phrases, otherwise it is just gibberish.

In this simple project, I focus only on anagram words and do not pay attention to the meaning of the word. I process a file in a simple way (capitalizing and sorting each word), then try to add each word as a key to anagram dictionary. 

If there is not such a key, it adds the key and then add the real word to the list items of that key, and if there is, it only adds the real word to the list items of that key.

So simple, so after process of all words, a dictionary of all anagram words will attained, that I write it to an output file.

After creating this dictionary;

It also contains a part that provide the user to input a word and then write out all of the anagrams of that word.

And also for a user to enter a number and see whether that number is the factorial of any numbers in the input file or not.
